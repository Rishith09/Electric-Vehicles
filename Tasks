Developed a Thermal model for an Electric Vehicle in Matlab Simulink. This model is used to reduce the high temperatures omitted from the battery and motor, which might effect the performance of the electric vehicle. 
Later got an internship at PuR Energy Private Limited, a 2-wheeler electric bike manufactuting company. During my Intenship period I have worked on Battery Management System testing and validation, Contoller Configuration, Electric Bike charger testing using CAN analyser and using the results detected the faults and provided solutions for the existing models.
